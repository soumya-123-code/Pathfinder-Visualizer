Overview
Pathfinder Visualizer is an interactive web application that demonstrates various pathfinding algorithms in a visual format. This project allows users to see how algorithms explore paths and find the shortest route between points on a grid. The visualizer provides an intuitive way to understand complex algorithms like Dijkstra's, A*, Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS).

Features üåü
Interactive Grid Interface: Users can create walls, set start and end points, and watch as algorithms find the shortest path.
Multiple Pathfinding Algorithms:
Dijkstra's Algorithm: The shortest path algorithm with weighted edges.
A* Algorithm: Optimized pathfinding using heuristics.
BFS: Explores the shortest path in an unweighted grid.
DFS: Explores as far as possible before backtracking.
Maze Generation Algorithms:
Recursive Division: Creates mazes with recursive sub-division.
Binary Tree: Simple and fast maze generation.
Horizontal & Vertical Division: Creates structured mazes.
Customizable Speed: Adjust the speed of the pathfinding visualization.
Responsive Design: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.
Built with Modern Technologies: React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for styling.
